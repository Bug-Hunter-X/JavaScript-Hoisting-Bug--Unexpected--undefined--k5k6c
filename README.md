# JavaScript Hoisting Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to variable hoisting. The code in `bug.js` attempts to log the value of a variable before it has been assigned a value, leading to an unexpected 'undefined' output. The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses this issue by ensuring the variable is assigned a value before it is accessed.
